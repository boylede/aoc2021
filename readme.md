# Advent of Code 2021

My entries for the annual advent of code puzzles.

Ths year I decided to start over somewhat and not use the testing / downloading harness I had built for previous years. Each day is structured as a separate binary and the inputs are downloaded by hand and included in the repository, unlike my prior year solutions which downloaded them if they were absent.
